The code for the talk "Consolidating Services using Middleware" first held at NDC London 2017

There is no code on master - rather each step along the way is in a branch. The order of the branches is "empty", "perf-logging", "correlation-di", "monitoring", "library", "rawowin", and "libowin".

The slides from the talk are at http://www.slideshare.net/c_horsdal/consolidating-services-with-middleware-ndc-london-2017
